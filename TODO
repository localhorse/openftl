- While shift is being held, clicking an entity that is not selected
  should not deselect anything _else_ currently selected.

- While shift is being held, clicking an already selected entity
  should deselect it.

- Selection box doesn't properly erase itself when drawn over a moving
  sprite!

- Added a bit of code with regards to scaling, but need to think about
  how we'll scale sprite images as well as coordinates.

- Instead of _not_ drawing certain areas of the border, we'll just
  clear the spots under the doors... after some observation, it
  appears that's what FTL does, anyways (BG colored gaps to the left of
  some doors when sensors are down).

- Need to fix door loading... it appears to be loading correctly, but
  this is misleading because if a room ever contains 2 horizontal or 2
  vertical doors, we'll have 2 doors literally right on top of each
  other. This will become important when doing the pathfinding code.

- If we make all the tiles occupied by rooms passable, but make the
  more costly than the door tiles, the pathfinding should work and
  they should move between rooms only through the doors? I suppose
  this will require modifying GridMap slightly (the move_cost() method
  and the map which contains boolean values, we'll need at least 3
  values).

- Tried several ways of making the doors open when someone passes
  through, and they all ended up triggering doors when they shouldn't
  have. It should be fairly trivial (once the grid map contains door
  information) to tell when the character is actually passing through
  a node with a door in it. (Although I suppose that door could be to
  the right of or below the node.)
