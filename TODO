- While shift is being held, clicking an entity that is not selected
  should not deselect anything _else_ currently selected.

- While shift is being held, clicking an already selected entity
  should deselect it.

- Selection box doesn't properly erase itself when drawn over a moving
  sprite!

- There's already an image for floor! I'm not sure what this is used
  for though because it seems as though the floor layoung is generated
  dynamically... that's how I'd rather do it, anyways. Needs looking
  into, though. It appears to only be for the Kestrel so it may just
  be an unused image.

- In the Engi cruiser ("circle_scout") data file there is no X_OFFSET
  or Y_OFFSET. The ship loading needs to be more robust and check for
  each field, and giving default values of zero when fields are not
  present.
