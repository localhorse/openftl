- While shift is being held, clicking an entity that is not selected
  should not deselect anything _else_ currently selected.

- While shift is being held, clicking an already selected entity
  should deselect it.

- Selection box doesn't properly erase itself when drawn over a moving
  sprite!

- Added a bit of code with regards to scaling, but need to think about
  how we'll scale sprite images as well as coordinates.

- Need to work on pathfinding code... this means we need a better
  representation of the rooms/doors. I can't think of a good model at
  the moment that would work for our purposes... basically we need
  Ship to know where the doors will be while drawing the room borders,
  and we need Person to know where the doors are for pathfinding
  purposes.

- Instead of _not_ drawing certain areas of the border, we'll just
  clear the spots under the doors... after some observation, it
  appears that's what FTL does, anyways (BG colored gaps to the left of
  some doors when sensors are down).
