- While shift is being held, clicking an entity that is not selected
  should not deselect anything _else_ currently selected.

- While shift is being held, clicking an already selected entity
  should deselect it.

- Selection box doesn't properly erase itself when drawn over a moving
  sprite!

- There's already an image for floor! I'm not sure what this is used
  for though because it seems as though the floor layoung is generated
  dynamically... that's how I'd rather do it, anyways. Needs looking
  into, though. It appears to only be for the Kestrel so it may just
  be an unused image.

- Doors won't have to be drawn manually, I found a sprite sheet. We'll
  have to leave a gap of that size, however, in the room borders.

- Started adding some door code, but I am thinking the doors should be
  sprite objects. I can continue to load doors so the room border
  function can avoid drawing where the doors should be, but I need to
  think about this more.

- Added a bit of code with regards to scaling, but need to think about
  how we'll scale sprite images as well as coordinates.
